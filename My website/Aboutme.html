<div class="Hobbies">
 <h2> My hobbies </h2>
 <p> &bull;&nbsp;I enjoy playing sports especially badminton. I have been playing badminton since primary school and I don't intend to stop. Basketball is also another sport that I spend a lot of my time on. </p>
 <p> &bull;&nbsp;I also love to hit the gym whenever I can. Since last year, I have been making an effort to go to the gym at least 3 times a week but due to hectic schedule, I could only hit the gym once or twice a week now. </p>
 <p> &bull;&nbsp;I like to try new things for new experiences too. I am currently trying out handball in my current school and I am also considering to try out billiard too. </p>
 <p> &bull;&nbsp;Playing computer games with my friends is also one of my hobbies. I would play together with my friends when we are online and the game I spent most my time on is League of Legends (LOL).   </p> 
 <p> &bull;&nbsp;I enjoy going out with my friends for a great catch up session and for meals. This is one of the things that I look forward to daily.  </p>
 <p> &bull;&nbsp;I also love watching anime (animated media) and Korean variety shows. I would watch anime or Korean variety shows whenever I am free.  </p>

<p> &bull;&nbsp;I would like to travel to a new country every year. </p>

</div>

<div class="SW">
<h2> My strengths and weaknesses and ways to improve </h2>
<p class="SWW">Strengths <br/>
 <p>&bull;&nbsp;I always trying to improve myself. I believe that constantly improving myself is an important thing and is a form of respect to myself </p>
 <p>&bull;&nbsp;I desire to be more knowledgeable. Having more knowledge is equilvalent to improving myself and it is important to have more knowledge of things other than knowledge from textbooks, which are limited.  </p>
 <p>&bull;&nbsp;I love to overcome challenges. I see challenges as a stepping stone that will constantly help to guide and mold me to a better person than I was. Addtionally, by overcoming challenges, it provides me with a great sense of achievement, pride and joy. </p>
 <p>&bull;&nbsp;I am perseverant. I believe it is important to be perseverant in everything we do because that will give us the drive and motivation as well as the confidence to conquer challenges and tough times.  </p>
<p class="SWW"> Weaknesses <br/>
<p>&bull;&nbsp;I am a person that procrastinates a lot. And when I say a lot, I mean saving my work till the very last minute until it piles up like a mountain which I would then start to work on it.  </p>
<p>&bull;&nbsp;I am not someone that can handle stress every well. I tend to break down when things get too stressful and would always reproach myself for not handling the situation well. </p>
<p>&bull;&nbsp;I am not someone that can handle my emotions very well. I always let my emotions get in my way which causes me to not think rationally in situations, resulting to bad decision making in the end. </p>
<p>&bull;&nbsp;I am very backward-looking. I tend to look back to the past more than focusing on what is going on now.  </p>
<p>&bull;&nbsp;Unappreciative at times. Sometimes I would take others people's advice as a form of criticism to me that I do not appreciate but I did not think about the intention that they have behind their advices.  </p>
</div>
<div class="Improve">
  <p class="SWW">Ways to improve</p>
  <p>&bull;&nbsp;I need to improve on my time management as well as my laziness. This will help me to overcome my procrastinations so I would not feel stressed out when datelines for my school work are approaching.</p>
  <p>&bull;&nbsp;I can learn to better manage my stress levels by taking breaks time to time and distract myself by divert my attention away from things that are causing me to be stressed out.  </p>
  <p>&bull;&nbsp;I should pause and think before I do anything. This is so that I would not allow my emotions to get the better of me so that I can make calm and rational decisions that will not make things worse.</p>
  <p>&bull;&nbsp;I should focus my attention on what is actually happening than what has already happened. This is because I do not have the ability to turn back time to change what has already happened but I do have the ability to change what is going to happen.</p>
  <p>&bull;&nbsp;I should learn to be more appreciative and be contented with whatever I have. I believe that being contented with what I have is really important because it will then bring happiness. We often overestimate the external factors (money,materialistic objects) when it comes to happiness but that should be considered a bonus than a requirement. It is the little things that count.</p>
